  <h2 class="header">Roundtable Technology ≠ Equality All about technology inequality</h2>
  <p class="article">
   One of the priorities that we try to maintain is equality. In this period that we live in, People support equality by using technology. When we see inequality, we immediately show that we oppose this situation with the media because technology allows us to reach everyone the fastest way possible. So I would like to ask you, “Do you believe that technology means equality?” What kind of inequalities do you think there can be in technology? We would be glad to hear your opinion.
Let’s discuss together equality and inequality in technology with a roundtable!

  <h2 class="header">Smelly cat</h2>
  <p class="article">
    "Smelly Cat" is a comedy song from the American sitcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">Friends</a> (1994–2004), originally performed by American actress Lisa Kudrow. The song was written by Friends writers Adam Chase and Betsy Borns, with musician Chrissie Hynde and Kudrow for the latter's character Phoebe Buffay, and first appears in the sixth episode of the show's second season, "The One with the Baby on the Bus". Hynde guest stars in the episode as a singer hired to replace Phoebe as Central Perk's in-house musician, to whom Phoebe eventually teaches "Smelly Cat". Borns originally intended to write the song about a dog, initially basing it on her own pet dog Gouda, but ultimately decided that a song about a pungent cat would be funnier.

  "Soft Kitty" is a children's song, popularized by the characters Sheldon and Penny in the American sitcom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory"> The Big Bang Theory</a>, and which elsewhere may be rendered as "Warm Kitty". According to claims in a copyright lawsuit, the words to "Warm Kitty" were written by Edith Newlin.

   In The Big Bang Theory, the song is described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he is ill. The lyrics on The Big Bang Theory are: "Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur! Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr!" A scene in an episode of Young Sheldon, the prequel series to The Big Bang Theory, depicts the origin of the song. This aired on February 1, 2018, and shows Sheldon's mother Mary singing the song to her son, who is suffering with the flu.
