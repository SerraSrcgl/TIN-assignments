In our program titled ‘Social Polarization: The Role of Media’, we focused on common misconceptions and stereotypes about Europe and the Middle East. Once again, we realized that one of the most important ways to reach genuine information is to get to know each other and to eliminate prejudices.</p>

    <p>While evaluating events or situations within a polarized social structure, media is the most important element. Considering that media has a guiding effect on the views and behaviors of individuals,</p><img class="text" src="https://www.dialoginstytut.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WhatsApp-Image-2020-10-26-at-7.09.14-PM.jpeg"><p> it is positioned as an effective actor. While this is the case on a national basis, do we know enough about the situation at international level? What is the role of media in the formation of the view of western societies to the rest of the world, and vice versa? In this program we will try to look especially at Europe and the Middle East.

    <p>One of the priorities that we try to maintain is equality. In this period that we live in, People support equality by using technology. When we see inequality, we immediately show that we oppose this situation with the media because technology allows us to reach everyone the fastest way possible. So I would like to ask you, “Do you believe that technology means equality?” What kind of inequalities do you think there can be in technology? We would be glad to hear your opinion.
Let’s discuss together equality and inequality in technology with a roundtable!
